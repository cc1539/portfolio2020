			<div id="about-section">
				<p>I'm Christopher Cheng, a 4th year university student majoring in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. I am a mostly self-taught programmer, as is typical for this day and age. My interests include computational physics (and physics in general), quantum computing, machine learning (particularly deep learning), cryptography, and parallel computing. Aside from programming, my hobbies include badminton, writing short stories that will never see the light of day, cooking, and occasionally drawing.</p>
