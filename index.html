					<p style="font-size:30px;">Hey there!</p>
					<p>Thanks for checking out this page.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h2>Objective</h2>
					<p>
					I’m a graduate student with experience in computational physics, distributed computing, and statistical estimation, who loves to learn and has broad interests. What I’m looking for is a software development position in a company that invests in its employees, by not only providing a challenging environment that encourages one to keep learning new skills, but also by valuing our time and freedom and allowing us to explore our interests outside of work, where we might find hidden insights that make us not just better workers but better people as well.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
					<p>See my list of skills at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-cheng-75b900152/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
					
					<!--
					<br>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>I graduated as an Honors College Scholar from the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, with a final cumulative GPA of 3.815 and a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. My first three years were mostly par for the course, with a hackathon here and there. Last year was the most exciting for me, in more ways than one; I could focus more on electives such as Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, but as a result of the ongoing pandemic, those and all my other courses moved online.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>Even before entering grade school, I was always interested in learning how things worked. I would frequent the public library and search for books on physics, chemistry, and other fields of science. As one might expect, the titles I selected were highly introductory and offered very little beyond surface level knowledge, so I can't say too much about the depth of my middle-school self’s knowledge. I will, however, vouch for its breadth, specifically in the field of the physical sciences. For this I had the internet to thank, especially later when I was first given access to the family PC and went down many a "Wikipedia rabbit hole".</p><p>At this point one might expect that computers becoming the next major focus of my curiosity would happen naturally and rather uneventfully, but for me, the interest was actually jumpstarted by a little incident, wherein I downloaded what I thought was a copy of WinRAR, but was actually a piece of malware that then further downloaded and deployed a whole bunch of other malware, with the end result of making my computer unable to even boot. I was left with no choice but to reformat the disk, and upon learning that what had transpired was the direct result of the malicious intent of another human being, I became . . . curious.</p><p>Of course, I was still annoyed, but it was in that awkward state of dissatisfaction that my curiosity was piqued. What exactly happened to my computer? Why did it behave in the way that it did? Why and how did people make my computer blow up like it did? Such questions are what led me to the realm of software, where further research and self-study over the years convinced me that a career in software development would be the way to go. I know this sounds weird, but to whoever made that virus; not cool, but thanks anyway.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
					<p>Here is a list of topics/skills that I believe are relevant for the positions that I will be applying to in the forseeable future, and some of my thoughts on them.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Version Control</b> - As may be evident from how this page and the projects listed below are published, my go-to version control software is Git.</li>
						<li><b>Machine Learning</b> - I am capable of implementing classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, and have more than a passing knowledge of deep learning with neural networks.</li>
						<li><b>Big Data</b> - I essentially see this as machine learning, but with more emphasis on logistics (do I need to run this algorithm using a cloud service, or are our computing clusters powerful enough, etc...)</li>
						<li><b>Agile Development</b> - I find it strange that a word needed to be made for this; does a developer not essentially do "agile" for themselves already in the process of writing and testing their software?</li>
						<li><b>Project Managment</b> - Got plenty of experience with this by working with a seven-member team in my Software Development class (though admittedly my main role was that of a full-stack developer).</li>
						<li><b>Blockchain</b> - I had a little look into Ethereum a little while back, because I was interested in how it might be able to facilitate distributed computing.</li>
						<li><b>Knowledge of Frameworks</b> - Spring, .NET, React, etc.</li>
						<li><b>Knowledge of Libraries</b> - I've worked with many libraries in the past, mainly for Java; most recently I've made extensive use of the Processing and Unirest libraries for some experiments in automated trading.</li>
						<li><b>Knowledge of Available Software</b> - The obvious mention here are Microsoft Office products, which I made extensive use of during my time at Rutgers University. I also made use of Adobe products, such as Photoshop. Coming back to programming, I have used VS2019, Code:Blocks, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and also just gcc without any IDE.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

					<p>Here is a selection of software projects that I had worked on in the past. I chose each of them because I think they not only demonstrate a facet of my technical skill and knowledge, but also because they simultaneously highlight my interests.</p>
